## Introduction:
Machine Learning is a field of study that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. This repository serves as a practical guide to understanding and implementing machine learning techniques through a series of Python scripts.

The scripts provided here demonstrate various applications, including:
* Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) Analysis: Explore the SVD technique for matrix factorization and dimensionality reduction.
* Data Analysis with Curve Fitting: Perform data analysis and curve fitting using machine learning algorithms.
* Neural Networks in Prediction: Build and train neural networks for prediction tasks.
* Matrix Computations: Understand and implement matrix operations and computations.
* Machine Learning Models for Classification: Implement machine learning models for classification problems.
These scripts are designed to help you gain hands-on experience with different aspects of machine learning and develop a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts.
